                            documentary, and well worth a watch. But when the
                            ice cap isn’t being overrun by AT-AT Walkers (see
                            the photo below if you’re not too clued up on your
                            Star Wars knowledge!) or Trolls, Hardanger is home
                            to the sixth-largest glacier in mainland Norway
                            which can be easily accessed by Finse railway
                            station, where a direct train runs from Bergen.

                                Other than Hardanger’s historical importance in
                                Star Wars, there are other reasons that someone
                                might choose to go there. For myself, those
                                reasons constituted a few things:

                                1. I needed to test out a specific type of
                                glacier geophysical seismic acquisition as part
                                of my PhD.

                                meaning I could apply for funding to visit it.

                                forms where snow becomes denser and turns into
                                ice) – the thing that I was wanting to study
                                using geophysics.

                                These three reasons combined meant not only was
                                I able to apply for funding to support my trip
                                to Norway, (a BIG thank you to EU Interact) it
                                also meant, due to the accessibility of the
                                glacier (in comparison to perhaps… Antarctica),
                                the logistics of testing a geophysical survey
                                that might not work were relatively easy.<br /><br />The
                                plan was to have two field seasons out in
                                Norway, the first in 2018, where I would scope
                                out the best places on the ice cap for my
                                research where there was known firn coverage,
                                and do some test surveys, and the second a year
                                later in 2019, where I would collect my final
                                dataset.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                            We packed up all our equipment in the UK and got it
                            sent by cargo ferry to Norway. Here we picked it up
                            and then had to attempt to ‘sneak’ the equipment
                            onto the national Norwegian passenger train.<br /><br />Luckily
                            for us, we had a few locals travelling with us up to
                            Finse, who was able to help us sweet talk the
                            conductors and fortunately, our five, 70kg boxes
                            were allowed onto the train, but they did get a few
                            funny looks.<br /><br />Once we arrived at Finse,
                            transportation of the equipment became a bit easier,
                            we could just pop all the cargo (including PhD
                            students!) into the sledges, and skidoo ourselves
                            around. It was April when we visited Hardanger, the
                            perfect time between the winter’s high winds and
                            thick snow, and the springs higher temperatures and
                            snowmelt. The end of April provides a sweet spot,
                            where there is enough snow that you’re still able to
                            skidoo around the glacier, but the weather is much
                            calmer, allowing for the geophysical surveys to be
                            carried out in the optimum conditions.<br /><br />Once
                            we arrived at the station, we had two weeks to
                            collect all the data we hoped for (two seismic
                            surveys and some GPR over the ice cap).<br /><br />Of
                            course, this all went perfectly to plan, we were
                            done by the first week, and then had a week to
                            relax, enjoy the scenery, and get some sledging in….
                            or.. not.<br />

                            We were heading back to Hardanger in April 2019,
                            only this year with more equipment (we were going to
                            drill a borehole on the top of the glacier!), more
                            data aims, more time, and more people! We had aimed
                            for the same time of year as it had worked well for
                            us the year before. We packed up the equipment,
                            snuck it onto the train in Bergen (well.. this year
                            we had to pay for ‘bike storage’) and headed to
                            Finse. It was at this point we started to worry a
                            little as we looked out the train window, we were
                            seeing a lot of green and a lot of water, but
                            fortunately no trolls.<br /><br />With the warm
                            weather at the front of our minds, the lake which we
                            had to cross to get to the glacier was melting more
                            and more each day, and the warm weather meaning our
                            route to the ice cap was becoming more rocky and
                            grassy rather than snow, time was of the essence. To
                            add to this, there was a fuel shortage on station as
                            the early arrival of spring had prevented more fuel
                            being transported to the research station, meaning
                            every trip in the skidoo needed to be as efficient
                            as possible. We sat down, and on the big blackboard
                            in the research station, planned out the bare
                            minimum that all three teams at the station would
                            need in order to get the data they were after.<br /><br />It
                            seemed that this year, although the sun gods were
                            VERY much on our side (quite possibly too much), the
                            skidoo gods were not.<br />

                                That afternoon we headed out to the bottom of
                                the ice cap to drop off equipment. It was at
                                this point we learnt that the soft slushy snow
                                meant the amount of weight we could have in the
                                sledges was greatly reduced. After getting stuck
                                in a slushy/icey mix, we realised we were going
                                to have to shuttle equipment and people back and
                                forth in a logistical dance. Ensuring we didn’t
                                waste fuel, didn’t break through the lake ice,
                                and thanks to the appearance of the rocks,
                                having to take a new route to get to the foot of
                                the glacier each time we headed out.<br /><br />Even
                                though we were at the station for almost 3 weeks
                                this time, I only needed a minimum of two sunny
                                (but cold) days to get the data I needed from
                                the ice cap, and whilst keeping an eye on the
                                weather every day, waiting for the cold, (yet
                                sunny) spell to hit, on day 7, they arrived.<br /><br />With
                                the sledge packed as light as possible, and some
                                ferrying of equipment and people done (and only
                                one very stuck skidoo hiccup later), using the
                                GPS coordinates from the previous year, we got
                                back to my field site. At this point, we hit the
                                ground running, and got to surveying. The plan
                                for day one on the ice cap was to shoot a
                                seismic line in the same position as the
                                previous year, but with the geophones closer
                                together, and a larger coverage of data. With
                                the help from the other team members, setting up
                                the seismic line was quick going, and the
                                acquisition went smoothly, once again with Adam
                                at the seismic source, (fortunately less hammer
                                shots than the year before), and myself on the
                                laptop.<br />

                                sorting out the borehole. It sounded as though
                                this was all going well, until a loud ‘CRAP’
                                spilled out across the top of the otherwise
                                quiet ice cap. It quickly surfaced that the
                                sound had been Bryn Hubbard, as we looked across
                                to him with a broken drill in hand and a
                                borehole stuck 2m deep in the snow. This didn’t
                                mean the end for the borehole, only that we had
                                to adjust our aims for the depth as we would be
                                hand drilling the hole, and that we had to do a
                                little bit of digging to recover the end of the
                                borehole. Although time-consuming, digging out
                                the borehole meant we had a snow pit in the
                                firn, allowing us to get a close up look at the
                                density variations in the top 2m of the site,
                                (we were also able to use the blocks of snow dug
                                out to make a really great igloo, but that’s
                                beyond the point!)<br /><br />With our original
                                aim of 30m deep scaled back to 10m, we spent the
                                rest of the day taking shifts at hand drilling
                                into the ice, we reached a depth of 11m, and
                                called it a success! With a few bits of glacier
                                ice collected to take home to have in some gin
                                and tonics, we were all very happy with what we
                                had achieved that day, (I can promise you, gin
                                and tonic tastes even better when accompanied by
                                ice cubes you drilled yourself). With a bit more
                                resilience than we previously had, some
                                successful data acquisition, and the optimism of
                                another sunny but cold day, we were all excited
                                for the following day.<br />

                                With our good data day behind us, the next day
                                was a quicker start, with all the equipment
                                already on the ice cap we just had to get up
                                there and shoot the downhole seismic. The
                                weather wasn’t as nice as we’d anticipated, but
                                as it had stayed cold, it was safe to get to the
                                ice cap. Once there, it was just a case of
                                laying out our geophones around the borehole and
                                using our downhole seismic source to acquire the
                                data. Remarkably, for the first time in two
                                field seasons, everything, went smoothly and to
                                plan! With spirits high, and a few more bits of
                                ice collected, we headed off the ice cap in a
                                few ferried shifts, taking the equipment back to
                                base, and took a deep sigh of relief. Two years
                                of planning for data acquisition had all come
                                together! The rest of the week saw the warm
                                weather return, meaning the route to the glacier
                                became near on impossible to traverse, unless
                                the skidoo had suddenly grown wheels to get over
                                all the newly appearing boulders. Meaning we
                                were limited with what we could do, but sledging
                                on station was always an option.<br /><br />It’s
                                clear to see from two fieldwork trips to Norway,
                                that even with the best intentions of planning,
                                things don’t often go the way you expect! None
                                the less, I had two fantastic field seasons,
                                with great company, amazing food, and a few
                                awesome datasets collected!<br /><br />I want to
                                say the biggest thank you to everyone who has
                                helped over my two field seasons, most notably
                                Adam Booth for being the power behind the
                                seismic sledgehammer. A big thank you also to
                                Siobhan and James Killingbeck, Hannah Watts,
                                Benedict Reinardy for their help with acquiring
                                the seismic line. Bryn Hubbard and Katie Miles,
                                for their help with drilling the borehole. And
                                Kjell Magner for his logistical help on the
                                icecap, meaning we didn’t end up in a crevasse.
                                And of course, the biggest thank you to Marits,
                                for all the amazing food she cooked to keep us
                                sustained each day! And finally, thank you to
                                the INTERACT team for funding this
                                fieldwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;
